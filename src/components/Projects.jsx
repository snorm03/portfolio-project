            Calm App Redesign

        <p>
          I reimagined the Calm appâ€™s interface with a focus on clarity,
          comfort, and modern appeal. Every element was thoughtfully redesigned
          to ensure that user interactions feel intuitive and soothing. I
          introduced a refreshed color palette to minimize visual strain and
          evoke a serene, sleep-friendly atmosphereâ€”helping users unwind with
          ease.

          This project is a custom-built album review content management system
          developed with PHP. I leveraged MySQL to implement dynamic content
          functionality, allowing users to add, view, and manage album reviews
          in real time. The system is designed to be both functional and
          user-friendly, with a clean structure that supports easy content
          updates.

        <p>
          This mobile app was designed to help users track two common types of
          workouts: repetition-based and duration-based exercises. Built using
          React Native, the application offers a clean, intuitive interface and
          smooth interaction patterns to support a seamless workout experience.
