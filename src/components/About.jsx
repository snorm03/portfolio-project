          Hello, I'm a <strong>digital media</strong> student

        <p className="about-text">
          at the University of Central Florida with a passion for UX/UI design.
          I love the iterative process of design and am always eager to refine
          and improve user experiences. I have over two years of experience
          working with Figma, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p className="about-text">
          In addition to my design skills, I have basic knowledge of React and
          React Native, which helps me bridge the gap between design and
          development. Iâ€™m super excited about combining creativity with
          functionality to bring awesome digital experiences to life!
